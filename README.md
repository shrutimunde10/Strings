# Strings
## Theory;
A string is a class that defines objects that be represented as a stream of characters.In the case of strings, memory is allocated dynamically. More memory can be allocated at run time on demand. As no memory is preallocated, no memory is wasted.
#### Syntax:
char str[] = "Hello World!";
#### Different string functions:
1. You can get the length of a string object by using a size() function or a length() function.<br>
2.The + operator can be used between strings to add them together to make a new string. This is called concatenation.<br>
3.To find if string is palindrome or not :A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string.
